- Lesson 12 Life on a desert island
  > Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We
  > sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always
  > shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit fallls from the trees and you
  > never have to work. The other side of the picture is quite the opposite. Life
  > on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like
  > Robinsion Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an
  > element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity
  > to find out.
  >
  > > I also have the same imagination about the desert island and the other thing,
  > > so I want to try it by myself.
- Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world
  > He described it as 'a very agreeable situation locate within two small hills
  > in the midst of which flowed a great river'.
  >
  > > I think the sentence is so flexible.
  >
  > Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's
  > dream to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.
  >
  > > I like the opinion.
- Lesson 18 Electric current in modern art
  > Oddly shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling and move in reponse to
  > a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody.
- Lesson 23 One man's meat is anothre man's posion
  > The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and
  > we stick to them all our lives.
  >
  > > Maybe I can try different food and different books.
- Lesson 26 Wanted: a large biscuit in
  > No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements. Much as we may pride
  > ourselves on our good taste, we are no longer free to choose the thing we want,
  > for advertising exerts a subtle influence on us. In their efforts to persuade
  > us to buy this or that product, adevertisers have made a close study of human
  > nature and have classified all our little weakness.
- Lesson 27 Nothing to sell and nothing to buy
  > It has been said that everyone lives by selling something. In the light of this
  > statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom
  > and priests by selling spiritual comfort. Though it may be possible to measure
  > the value of material goods in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to
  > estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us. There are
  > times when we would willingly to give everything we possess to save our lives,
  > yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this
  > service. The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for
  > in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. Everyone has something to
  > sell.
  >
  > Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-
  > by.
  >
  > > I think it's good opinion.
  >
  > His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to
  > place with ease.
  >
  > > Life can be so simple.
  >
  > We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as
  > beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little
  > envious of their simple way of life and their freedom from care?
- Lesson 29 Funny or not?
  > Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been
  > brought up. The sense of humor is mysteriously bound up with naitonal
  > characteristics.
- Lesson 33 A day to remember
  > We have all experienced days when everything gose wrong. A day may begin well
  > enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control. What invariably
  > happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the
  > same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of
  > reactions. Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on
  > the baby at the same time. The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to
  > an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby
  > pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and
  > cutting himself in the process. You hang up hurriedly and attent to baby,
  > crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to
  > reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests
  > to dinner.
  >
  > > That's so vivid.
- Lesson 35 Justice was done
  > There are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept.
  > Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of hunman interference.
  > At such times, justice acts like a living force. When we use a phrase like
  > 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of
  > circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.
- Lesson 36 The Westhaven Express
  > The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than
  > theirs.

- Lesson 42 Modern cavemen
  > Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively
  > new sport. Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an
  > unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. It is
  > impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. For
  > him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for
  > the climber. They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.
  >
  > The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted
  > by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger.

  > > That's me. I can't resist the temptation.
