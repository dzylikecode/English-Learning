- Lesson 12 Life on a desert island
  > Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We
  > sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always
  > shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit fallls from the trees and you
  > never have to work. The other side of the picture is quite the opposite. Life
  > on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like
  > Robinsion Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an
  > element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity
  > to find out.
  >
  > > I also have the same imagination about the desert island and the other thing,
  > > so I want to try it by myself.
