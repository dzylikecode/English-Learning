He will still have intensive practice in four skills, understanding, speaking,
listening, and writing, but many of the exercise he will be doning will be less
mechanical.

Now it is a curious paradox that formal examination often hinder rather than help
a student to learn a language. however, there should be no need to work at cross-
purpose: it is quite possible for the student to go on learning a language and
prepare for an examination at the same time. It must be clearly understood that
a formal examination with its bias towards the written language will only exert
a pernicious influence on language learning when it is regard as an end in
itself.

When the teacher(I think I am my own teacher) makes it his aim to get his class
through an examination and no more, he will undoubtedly fail to teach teh language
properly. An examination must always be regarded as something secondary, a by-
product which the student will take in his stride. It must never be regarded as an
end in itself.

An intermediate course should not only enable a student to go on learning English
systematically, but should, incidentally, enable him to pass an examination without
special preparation.

1. 不要思考与之无关的东西, 无论它是多么重要. 把注意力放在语句的节奏上, 想想自己会怎么
   表达英语语句里面的意思, 自己会强调哪部分, 自己怎么组织起整体的意思. 思考语句里面的场景, 把自己带入进去
2. 试图建立场景表达自己的想法, 比如看到"猫有九条命"的实验. I don't like it, because
   the experiment is a little cruel. But the reason why cats can protect 
   themselves when falling from high buildings is a little fascinating indeed.
